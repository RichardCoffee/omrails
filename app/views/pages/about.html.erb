<h1>About page</h1>
<p><%=link_to "One Month Rails","http://onemonthrails.com"%>
is a project to teach
<%=link_to "Ruby on Rails","http://rubyonrails.org"%>
in one month</p>
<p>I personally consider it a nice little course, even for non-programmers.  The instructor,
<%=link_to "Mattan Griffell","http://mattengriffel.com"%>, explains what you need to know very concisely.
He doesn't make any assumptions about what you might already know, but also doesn't over-load you with too many things at once.
He doesn't really go into why things work the way they do, so that's a area of knowledge you'll need to fill in on your own.
Be aware he does his programming on a Mac, so all the videos are from that perspective.
I use linux, so I didn't have any problem following his command line examples, since both use Unix-based kernels.
Don't know how that would work for a Windows machine though.
I noticed that he uses tabs when editing, which he seems to have issues with in a couple of the videos.
I uses spaces myself, so as not to have to worry about different tab expansions in different programs. YMMV.</p>
<p>As is normal with this type of instruction, you'll be pausing the videos frequently.
For the most of the videos, everything he types on-screen is also listed on the page, along with any errata.
This means you can just copy and paste if you want, although I recommend you actually type it in.
Consider it a coding 'good practice' rule.
For at least a couple of the lessons, you don't have this option, so it won't make any difference.
Exercise those digits.</p>
<p>Some of the things he shows you doesn't really have anything to do with rails, but rather deals with some of the tools that a web
designer uses, or can use, in developing web sites.  In the initial video, he shows you how to get started using
<%=link_to "Github","https://github.com"%>, which is nice.  I think everybody should at least know how github works, even if you don't use
it. He also shows you about <%=link_to "Heroku","http://www.heroku.com"%>, which appears to be mainly for ruby users.  In a later video he
explains about <%=link_to "Bootstrap","http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap"%>, which I highly recommend for those just starting out in web
design.  Any "old-timers" would also benefit from taking a look at it, even if you don't use it.  Later on in the series you have to
install ImageMagick, because of the upload gem.  I already had it so it wasn't an issue for me.
</p>
<p>Wish I could say some nice things about Rails.  Most of that project seems to be about obfuscation.  And, no, I'm not going to
justify that statement since I've already said enough to start a flame war as it is.<p>
<p>[later]  Okay, maybe I will say something.  If you want to use the MVC methodology, I recommend CodeIgniter for those already
familiar with web design.  Okay, I'll go away now.</p>
